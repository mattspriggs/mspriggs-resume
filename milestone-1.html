					substantial services that are provided to game development studios that require some technical skill
					at working with their fullstack of web applications for both custom development and maintenance.</li>

					and the client development studio and within the team and company.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h3>Proficiency</h3>
		<ul>

			<li>Billy prefers Windows and Android based tech but tolerates using Apple for work</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<!--Attitudes and Behaviors-->
	<div class="attitude-behaviors">
		<h3>Attitudes</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Billy loves technology and gaming</li>
			<li>Billy likes people and talking shop with other technophiles</li>
			<li>Billy has a lot of work stress and needs to find talent constantly</li>
			<li>Billy has had many applicants to sort through, many of whom are not qualified</li>
			<li>Billy's company has had issues with hiring individuals who cannot perform; so they are shifting to
				offering contract to hire positions.
				<ul>
					<li>This is both good and bad - the good is that they don't have to invest a lot into the development
						of the talent upfront and instead the contractor has incentive to prove their worth.</li>
					<li>The bad is that some contractors simply want the short gig and have no interest in becoming
						full-time employees and some contractors have not completed work on time and/or meet quality
						standards</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Billy finds this new approach even more challenging and has to focus more on outreach than sorting through
				applications, although he still has to do this also.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Behaviors</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Billy does not like being in his office and prefers to work from home or a coffee shop, which is
				allowed post pandemic</li>
			<li>Billy has developed a quick method for screening applications - if there is no mention of some technical
				training or a portfolio of work, the applicant goes to the bottom of the list.  This takes him 30 seconds or
				less in reviewing an application.</li>
			<li>Billy scours LinkedIn looking for any technologically minded individuals who may be looking for work.
				This can be more time-consuming and Billy relies heavily on endorsements of skill to assist.</li>
			<li>Billy will also review resumes on Indeed, again looking for some level of technical acumen.  Like
				the applications Billy reviews through their in-house HR system, this review takes no more than 30 seconds
				perform to determine if this is an applicant worth looking at any further.</li>
			<li>Billy, like many recruiters throughout the world, has been having a difficult time finding acceptable
				candidates, making his job much more stressful and difficult.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Frustrations</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Billy is very frustrated with the lack of good applicants coming in through the traditional channels</li>
			<li>Billy recognizes with the new labor market, post-pandemic, that there are far more entry level jobs
				than qualified applicants, but this is still a constant source of frustration</li>
			<li>Billy's job performance is dependent on finding and obtaining good employees but with so few candidates
				and with increased competition for those candidates his level of effort is increased immensely</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<h2>Use Case</h2>
	<div class="use">
		<h3>Goals for using the site</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Billy is scouring LinkedIn for potential new development talent and finds a link to this site</li>
			<li>Billy wants to be able to quickly determine if this person:
				<ul>
					<li>has technical acumen as evidenced by a portfolio, certifications or endorsements</li>
					<li>is able to produce to a quality standard as evidenced in a portfolio of work</li>
					<li>is willing to be a contract to hire employee as evidenced by work history</li>
					<li>is available to work with other team members in the Pacific Rim</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Be able to contact this person if he finds evidence that they may be a quality candidate</li>
