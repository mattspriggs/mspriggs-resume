	<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
	<p>This will be a one-page website that will provide key information that can be quickly scanned by employers and companies interested in potentially:
		<ul>
			<li>Interviewing me for an open position</li>
			<li>Contracting with me for freelance work</li>
			<li>Offering a contract to hire position</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Secondarily the page will provide increased visibility and network connections within the web development sector.</p>
	<p>Because this site will tend to be heavy on words, the site will provide emphasis on the portfolio; emphasizing more visual and interactive content.  Also, the verbiage used will be succinct and well organized, emphasizing the use of lists and background scrolling where appropriate and short, declarative sentences.</p>
	</p>
		<h2>Welcome area</h2>
			<h3>Images</h3>
			<p>The top navbar will be overlaid on a landscape oriented background image and will use semi-transparent buttons to quickly move to sections of the page. When viewed on a mobile device, the navbar will collapse to an overlaid hamburger menu in the upper right and maintain the same background image.</p>
