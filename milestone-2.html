<!--Content Strategy Header-->
<div class="content">
	<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
	<p>This will be a one-page website that will provide key information that can be quickly scanned by employers and companies interested in potentially:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Interviewing me for an open position</li>
			<li>Contracting with me for freelance work</li>
			<li>Offering a contract to hire position</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Secondarily the page will provide increased visibility and network connections within the web development sector.</p>
	<p>Because this site will tend to be heavy on words, the site will provide emphasis on the portfolio; emphasizing more visual and interactive content.  Also, the verbiage used will be succinct and well organized, emphasizing the use of lists and background scrolling where appropriate and short, declarative sentences.</p>
