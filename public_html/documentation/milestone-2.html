<!--Content Strategy Header-->
<div class="content">
	<h1>Content Strategy</h1>
	<p>This will be a one-page website that will provide key information that can be quickly scanned by employers and companies interested in potentially:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Interviewing me for an open position</li>
			<li>Contracting with me for freelance work</li>
			<li>Offering a contract to hire position</li>
		</ul>
	<p>Secondarily the page will provide increased visibility and network connections within the web development sector.</p>
	<p>Because this site will tend to be heavy on words, the site will provide emphasis on the portfolio; emphasizing more visual and interactive content.  Also, the verbiage used will be succinct and well organized, emphasizing the use of lists and background scrolling where appropriate and short, declarative sentences.</p>
</div>
<!--Welcome area-->
<div class="welcome">
		<h2>Welcome section</h2>
			<h3>Navbar, images and title</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Desktop view
					<ul>
						<li>The top navbar will be overlaid on a landscape oriented background image and will use semi-transparent buttons to quickly move to sections of the page. </li>
						<li>At the lower left corner of the background image will be a headshot that will evenly straddle the background image and the content area and be inset slightly from the left edge of the background photo.</li>
						<li>My name will be slightly indented to the right of the headshot and overlay the background image</li>
						<li>Under my name will be two lines of text - Full Stack Web Developer and Resume & Portfolio - which will be completely contained in the content area below the background image.</li>
						<li>Adjacent to these lines of text and centered on the space between the lines, will be an envelope icon that when clicked will open a contact modal window with the ability to email me or go to my LinkedIn profile</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Mobile view
					<ul>
						<li>When viewed on a mobile device, the navbar will collapse to an overlaid hamburger menu in the upper right and maintain the same background image.</li>
						<li>The headshot will shift to the left edge of the background image</li>
						<li>The name, title and envelope icon for launching the contact modal will remain the same as the desktop view</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
<!--Skills section-->
			<h3>Skills</h3>
			<p>The skills section will provide separate lists for Soft and Tech skills.</p>
				<ul>
					<li> Desktop view
						<ul>
							<li>The top 3 skills in the list will be readable and the 4th will be partially viewable and lead the viewer to possibly scroll or hover to reveal more:
								<ul>
									<li>Scroll within that sub window to see the rest of the skills.</li>
									<li>Possibly use a modal that exposes the full list when hovered over</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Mobile view
						<ul>
							<li>The lists will collapse to a drop-down clickable list that will either expand or open a modal view and will be labeled with Soft and Tech respectively.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

<!--Portfolio section-->
			<h3>Portfolio</h3>
			<p>The portfolio section will provide six examples of work. The work will be presented in clickable thumbnail images linking to the project depicted in the thumbnail. Each thumbnail will have a semi-transparent label with the title of the example of work. When clicked the location will open in a new tab so that the user can easily move between the main page and the location of the work.</p>
			<p>Below the thumbnail will be a link to the GitHub repository for the code of the featured project. These links will also open in a new tab.</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Desktop view
					<ul>
						<li>The thumbnails are arranged in two rows of three evenly spaced with the middle thumbnail centered on the page.</li>
						<li>Immediately below the thumbnail will be a link to the GitHub repository centered on the above thumbnail.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Mobile view
					<ul>
						<li>The thumbnails will move to display as three rows of two, evenly spaced with the GitHub link centered on the thumbnail image just under each thumbnail.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

</div>
<!--Additional information area-->
	<div class="additional-information">
	<h2>Additional information section</h2>
	<p>The information provided here will only be relevant if the Welcome section hooks the viewer and should be below the scroll.</p>
<!--Education section-->
		<h3>Education</h3>
		<p>My education will be split between those that are relevant to the technical position I am seeking, this section, and the Other section where non-technical, less relevant education will be listed.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Desktop view
					<ul>
						<li>Will provide relevant education starting the with the most recent, Deep Dive Coding, and listing the two Bachelors that with the school attended and dates of attendance.</li>
						<li>Each entry will occupy a single line with type of education, institution and dates of attendance.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Mobile view
				<ul>
					<li>The mobile view will present the same information but will split the information into additional lines to improve line length and readability.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
<!--Certification section-->
		<h3>Certification</h3>
		<p>This section will list all relevant IT certifications that I have received.</p>

				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
<!--Experience section-->
		<h3>Experience</h3>
		<p>This section will show my last 12 years of work experience, demonstrating longevity and strong, high level responsibility and work.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Desktop view
				<ul>
					<li>This will be a list of the positions held over the last 12 years with business, location, title and dates of employment</li>
					<li>The list will be left aligned with a large white space on either side. The first line of each block has the business name and location with the title and dates indented on a new line. This provides some asymmetry to help the eye flow </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Mobile view
				<ul>
					<li>Will appear similar to the desktop view but the white space reduced to fit the screen but continuing the same left aligned first line and the additional lines indented.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
<!--Other section-->
		<h3>Other</h3>
		<p>This section contains the unrelated education in the same format as the relevant education and also includes my Martial Arts ranking as a demonstration of interests and accomplishments.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Desktop view
				<ul>
					<li>The unrelated education will mirror the format of the previous education section</li>
					<li>The martial arts section will mirror the work experience layout used previously with white space and left aligned first line and indented sub items.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Mobile view
				<ul>
					<li>The unrelated education in mobile view will mirror the mobile view of the previous education section, splitting the information into lines per information type instead of on a single line.</li>
					<li>Similar to the previous work experience section, the martial arts section will maintain the pattern but without the use of the white space on either side.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Footer</h3>
		<p>The footer will be a thick black bar along the bottom and will contain linking icons for LinkedIn, the envelope icon in the center for activating the email contact modal, and FaceBook. </p>
		<p>This is consistent in both the desktop and mobile views.</p>
